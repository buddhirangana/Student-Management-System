# Student-Management-System

The project that is going to be developed is about the student management system for school. Student Management System is software which is helpful for students as well as the school authorities. In the current system all the activities are done manually. It is very time consuming and costly. Our Student Management System deals with the various activities related to the students.

This system was required to automate the processing of student details, which was done manually before the development of the package. Earlier all the information / data pertaining to the student was maintained manually or we can say it was on paper, hence it created a problem for the school, how to manage it properly. With the help of this system the school is able to maintain the data properly and accurately.

Why System was built?

* Earlier, data pertaining to students was maintained manually.
* Manual system was not efficient.
* Large manpower was required.
* Cost of maintaining data manually was bigger or huge.
* Not suited for electronic exchange of data.
