# Student-Management-System
The Final VIVA of the major project in the program DIT.

As the name specifies "Student Management System" is a software developed for managing various activities in the school. For the past few years the number of educational institutions is increasing rapidly. Thereby the number of schools is also increasing for the accommodation of the students studying in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on the person who are running the school and software's are not usually used in this context. This particular project deals with the problems on managing a school and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually.
